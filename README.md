# Country Info Application
This application allows you to search for and retrieve detailed information about countries worldwide, such as their capital, population, region, currency, and more. It fetches data from a public REST API.

Why it Does it
This project serves as a practical demonstration of:

* Making HTTP requests to external APIs using the requests library.

* Parsing JSON responses and extracting relevant data.

* Handling potential API errors or edge cases.


# Technologies Used
* Python (Specify version, e.g., 3.7.10 +)
* Requests (for making HTTP calls)
* External API: REST Countries API (or whichever API you used)
